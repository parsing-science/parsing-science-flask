        <p>
        I'm Nicole; I'm a Data Scientist. <br> <br>
        I have a PhD in Physics from Berkeley; my research focused on computational neuroscience. After grad school, I spent time at the Exploratorium and doing QA/Tech Support at Automatic. <br> <br>
        I then moved to Chicago and worked at the Center for Elementary Math and Science Education at the University of Chicago. I developed online interactive math activities and worked on a data analysis tool. <br><br>
        I started my data science career at Shiftgig. I spent all day playing with fun tools like Jupyter notebooks, pandas, scikitlearn, and pymc3. I'm about to start working at ShopRunner. <br><br>
        I also teach for Girls Who Code and like to go to PyLadies and PyData Chicago meetups.
