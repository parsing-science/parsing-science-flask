        <h1>About Me </h1>
        <p>
        I'm Nicole (she/her/hers), a Data Science Manager. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are very important to me, and I'm always happy to chat about how tech companies can improve in those areas. As my teammates know, I am extremely into organizing things like code (every single person has had a code review from me asking them to alphabetize their imports). I also enjoy thinking about how to make DS processes more efficient.<br><br>
        Currently, I'm on the Data Science team at ShopRunner. I've been focusing on Natural Langugage Processing (NLP) for the last year or so. My latest project involves extracting product attributes from descriptions.<br><br>
        I have a PhD in Physics from Berkeley; my research focused on computational neuroscience. After grad school, I spent time at the Exploratorium and doing QA/Tech Support at Automatic. <br> <br>
        I then moved to Chicago and worked at the Center for Elementary Math and Science Education at the University of Chicago. I developed online interactive math activities and worked on a data analysis tool. <br><br>
        I started my Data Science career at Shiftgig. I spent all day playing with fun tools like Jupyter notebooks, pandas, scikitlearn, and PyMC3. <br><br>
        You can often find me at PyLadies and PyData Chicago meetups.<br><br>
        In January 2019, I spent a week at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com" target="_blank"> Recurse Center</a>.
